It looks like you’ve provided a raw OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scan of your resume. While the content is strong, the scan contains many typos (e.g., "F lut,ter," "Firebmse," "Cit") and formatting glitches that would prevent it from passing through an ATS (Applicant Tracking System).

I have cleaned up the text, corrected the technical terms, and reorganized it into a professional, industry-standard format for you.
